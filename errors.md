# Put your errors here!!!
My errors:

1. -- add_index(:recipes_ingredients, :recipe_id, :ingredient_id) rails aborted!
  
    StandardError: An error has occurred, this and all later migrations canceled:
    wrong number of arguments (given 3, expected 2)


 After this error I added second index separately on the next line
